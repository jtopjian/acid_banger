## About

Acid Banger is a port of the [Endless Acid Banger](https://www.vitling.xyz/toys/acid-banger/) and
the [Spicy Endless Acid Banger](https://zykure.github.io/acid-banger/) for [Norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/).

It endlessly generates two 303 patterns and one drum pattern.

This script only outputs MIDI. It does not generate any sound on its own.
